## Reward Shaping with Dynamic Guidance to Accelerate Learning for Multi-Agent Systems

### Overview

This repository is derived from [DennyBritz's Reinforcement Learning Library](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)

This README also needs some more work

Contribution: 
- Tanay: Designed the environment, ideated and implemented guided reward shaping, and did data analysis. 
- Jordan: Tested various environments and algorithms and ideated and implemented curriculum based reward shaping
